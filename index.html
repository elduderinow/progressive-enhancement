          <h2 class="title2">The story</h2>

          <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said:</q>  <br /><br />

            <q class="vil quote">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> <br /><br />

            The farmer said: <br /><br />

            <q class="china quote"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q>  <br /><br />

            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <br /><br /> 

            <q class="vil quote">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> <br /><br /> 

            The farmer again said: <br /><br /><q class="china quote"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q> <br /><br />

            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,<br /><br /> 

            <q class="vil quote">Oh dear, that’s too <q class="bad">bad</q></q><br /><br /> 

            and the farmer responded: <br /><br /><q class="china quote"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q><br /><br /> 

            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said:<br /><br /> 

            <q class="vil quote">Isn’t that great!</q><br /><br /> 

            Again, he said: <br /><br /><q class="china quote"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q><br /><br />
