          <h2>The story</h2>

          <p><span>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,</span>  <br /><br />

            <span class="vil quote">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</span> <br /><br />

            The farmer said, <br /><br /><span class="china quote"><strong>“Maybe”.</strong></span>  <br /><br />

            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <br /><br /> 

            <span class="vil quote">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</span> <br /><br /> 

            The farmer again said, <br /><br /><span class="china quote"><strong>“Maybe”.</strong></span> <br /><br />

            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,<br /><br /> 

            <span class="vil quote">“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,”</span><br /><br /> 

            and the farmer responded, <br /><br /><span class="china quote"><strong>“Maybe”.</strong></span><br /><br /> 

            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,<br /><br /> 

            <span class="vil quote">“Isn’t that great!”</span><br /><br /> 

            Again, he said, <br /><br /><span class="china quote"><strong>“Maybe”.</strong></span><br /><br />

            <br /><br />

          <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> <br /><br />

            — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</p>

              <strong><h3>Conclusion</h3></strong>  
              <span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
